                                    # Us vs Them

**What is it:**

A team vs team fitness challenge web app. Players compete by recording their steps taken, water intake, vegetable servings eaten, and minutes spent in active physical training. The team with the most points at the end of six weeks wins.

 

**Why build it:**

* Promote fitness through competition
* Comradery through shared team experiences.
* Using a web app provide instant access to stats, score, and ability to input stats anywhere.
* Paper-less fitness challenge.
* Automates the administration of the challenge instead of players’ manual writing their stats, keeping up with the stats, and submitting to team captains. The captains repeats the same process but on a team scale and submitting the stats to an administrator.
* Transparency in scoring at the player, team, and administration level.

 

**How to use/ Flow Chart:**

1. A player log into the web app with a player’s jersey number and password.
2. A simple user interface allows a player to input the four fitness categories (steps taken, water intake, vegetables servings eaten, and minutes spent in active physical training).
3. A score is formulated based on points awarded for each fitness category.
4. A final user interface will display the formulated player’s score and the player’s total points for the game. The player’s team total combine points and how the team rank against other teams will be displayed.
