                                   **Us vs Them**

**What is it:**

A team vs team fitness challenge web app. Players compete by recording their steps taken, water intake, vegetable servings eaten, and minutes spent in active physical training. The team with the most points at the end of six weeks wins.


**Motivation:**

* Automates the administration of a fitness challenge. The original system was for playersâ€™ to manual write their stats, keep up with the stats, and submit it to team captains. The captains repeats the same process but on a team scale and submit the stats to an administrator.
* Transparency in scoring at the player, team, and administration level.

 
**Why build it:**

* Promote fitness through competition
* Comradery through shared team experiences.
* A web app provide instant access to player's stats, team's score, and the ability to input stats anywhere/anytime.
* Paper-less fitness challenge.
